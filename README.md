To add the stash add this to your ox_inventory\data\stashes.lua
```{
		coords = vec3(150.8704, -1003.6064, -98.9825),
		target = {
			loc = vec3(149.47420, -1004.55900, -99.98502),
			length = 0.6,
			width = 1.8,
			heading = 90,
			minZ = 43.34,
			maxZ = 44.74
		},
		name = 'Apartmentstash',
		label = 'Apartement stash',
		owner = true,
		slots = 50,
